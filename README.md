## UX:
<hr>

### Site Owner's Goals:
<hr>

- To provide a resource for coffee drinkers to discover more information about coffee and the regions of the world it comes from.

- To promote information sharing about the coffee distribution chain

- To allow members to add coffees to the resource database and track coffees and new trends.
<br>
<hr>

### User Stories
<hr>

- As a site user I want to navigate the site to easily find the information I need

- As a site user I want to search for coffees by flavour profile so that I can focus my search

- As a site user I want to be able to like/unlike specific coffees

- As a site user I want to be able to register for an account to add coffees to the database

- As a site user I want to learn more about individual coffees and their producers so I understand more about where the coffee comes from

## Agile Model Planning
<hr>
<br>

I used Githubs [Kanban style project board](https://github.com/users/kreilly86/projects/3) to create user stories and categorise each story as either:
    -Must Have
    -Should Have
    -Could Have
<br>

## Features:

## Design 
<hr>

### Coffee Collect Logo
<br>
<img src="static/images/cclogo.png">
<br>
I created the Coffee Collect logo using canva. I was looking for a minimalistic design, which highlights the coffee plant, reminding us that the coffee we consume is from a plant, and a lot of work goes into cultivating it.
<br>
<br>

### Colour Scheme 
<br>

<br>
I kept the colour scheme of the site quite minimal not to distract from the message I wanted to put across. I felt like the darker blue, greys and beige fitted quite well with the photos of coffee farm and nature spread through the site.

### Images

### Navigation and menus
<br>
<hr>

<br>
I used Bootstrap's nav menu for the project as I wanted a sleek and easy design that worked across all devices. The menu disappears on smaller devices but has an easy to use hamburger style menu that opens to the left. Again this was in keeping with the minimalistic and clean colour scheme of the site.

When I was builing the database structure and creating an admin login superuser, I got an error message when I tried python3 manage.py runserver 
and typed in /admin/ at the end of the address bar.
