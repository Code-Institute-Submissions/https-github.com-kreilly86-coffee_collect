## UX:

### Site Owner's Goals:
<hr>

- To provide a resource for coffee drinkers to discover more information about coffee and the regions of the world it comes from.

- To promote information sharing about the coffee distribution chain

- To allow members to add coffees to the resource database and track coffees and new trends.

### User Stories
<hr>

- As a site user I want to navigate the site to easily find the information I need

- As a site user I want to search for coffees by flavour profile so that I can focus my search

- As a site user I want to be able to like/unlike specific coffees

- As a site user I want to be able to register for an account to add coffees to the database

- As a site user I want to learn more about individual coffees and their producers so I understand more about where the coffee comes from
