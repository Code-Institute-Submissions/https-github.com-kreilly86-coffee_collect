          We started Coffee Collect in 2020 during the Covid Pandemic as a way to keep connected with our colleagues
          in the coffee industry. We are a growing resource for coffee professionals and drinkers to learn more
          about where there coffee comes from and highlight some of the unique qualities of the coffee regions we
          represent.
          Too often we consume coffee without thinking of the hard work that goes into it throughout the production,
          and
          distribution chain.
          <br>
          <br>
          We are hoping you will join us and begin adding your own findings to the database, as we look to
          the future of an ever more fragile industry.
